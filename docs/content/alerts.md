#### Default alerts

Alerts are available for any length of text. For proper styling, use one of
the 5 required contextual classes (e.g., `.alert-success`).

{% for color in site.data.colors %}
  {% example html %}
  <div class="alert alert-{{ color.name }}" role="alert">
  This is a {{ color.name }} alert.
</div>
  {% endexample %}
{% endfor %}

#### Link color

Use the `.alert-link` utility class to quickly provide matching colored
links within any alert.

{% for color in site.data.colors %}
  {% example html %}
  <div class="alert alert-{{ color.name }}" role="alert">
  This is a {{ color.name }} alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>. Give it a click if you like.
</div>
  {% endexample %}
{% endfor %}

#### Additional content

Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs and
dividers.

{% example html %}
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Well done!</h4>
  <p>Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="mb-0">Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.</p>
</div>
{% endexample %}
